# Pull Request Templates

- Only availble in classic .md [markdown template formats](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-template-for-your-repository).
- Check out the [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-template-for-your-repository) for creating a pull request template.
- Notably, only 1 pull request template is on by default.
- For multiple templates, the [query parameter has to be manually tweeked](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/using-query-parameters-to-create-a-pull-request) to extract each one'; which is a bit arcahic. 
- Comparable Issue forms are not available for Pull Request Templates
