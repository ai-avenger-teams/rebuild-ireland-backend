## Using a respository template

- [ ] Check if  the tag <sub>![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Private_template-0d1117)</sub> | <sub>![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Public_template-0d1117)</sub> is next to repo name and a green <sub>![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Use_this_template-29903b)</sub> is in top right.
- Clone the template repo.

**Next Steps**

- [ ] Create a new repository:
  - [ ] Select repository template: `{org}/template-hackathon-base`.
  - [ ] Select a `repo owner` or `{org}`.
  - [ ] Assign new repo name & description.
  - [ ] Do not include all branches from source template (`unchecked`).
  - [ ] Designate: `Public` or `Private`.
  - [ ] Grant Marketplace apps access.
- [ ] New repo should have `generated from` source template.

## Clone repository template 

- [ ] Clone to local machine.
- [ ] Check if all team members can clone and fetch to repository.

## Getting Started 

> Per repository settings: https://github.com/{org/owner}/{repo}/settings

### Initial Config

## ðŸ“‚.github/

> Given the hidden nature of `ðŸ“‚.github/`, it is an excellent candiate to store customisation per repoistory instructions, as per below, and other local configs for each team member without impacting the organisation of the visible solutions project files. The benefits of using preconfigured configurations and templares, in a team collborations, are greater consistency and speed to first commit for the solution.

### READMEs

- `ðŸ“‚.github/readme.md` (this) is displayed until `ðŸ“‚./README.md` is edited and loaded in root of project. 
- `ðŸ“‚.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATES/readme.md` outlines the issue templates meta and purposes. Adapt as needed.
- `ðŸ“‚.github/local-config/readme.md` outline the local configurations for post cloning a repository setup. See also [../CONTRIBUTIONS.md](../CONTRIBUTORS.md).
- `ðŸ“‚.github/workflow/readme.md` outline the GitHub actions in use on the repository.

> <sub>This readme.md is located in ðŸ“‚./.github intentionally as this is a hidden folder and deals with per repo github settings. Edit as needed.</sub>

### Folders

- `ðŸ“‚.github/` stores the following folders:
  - `ðŸ“‚.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATES/` stores issue templates yml GitHub forms. Adapt as needed.
  - `ðŸ“‚.github/local-config/` stores the local configurations and samples for a post-cloning repository setup. See also [../CONTRIBUTIONS.md](../CONTRIBUTORS.md).
  - `ðŸ“‚.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATES/` stores PR template, as onlly one automatic, markdown template. Adapt as needed.
  - `ðŸ“‚.github/workflow/readme.md` stores the GitHub actions in use on the repository. Some can be located under `ðŸ“‚.github/`.

**Have you**
- [ ] Added a root level README.md
- [ ] Added a read and familarised self with `ðŸ“‚ISSUE TEMPLATES/readme.md` and `ðŸ“‚PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATES/readme.md`.
- [ ] Copy the contents of local-config to your prefered local settings/per team member.

- Consider the more optional, for a hackathon, files, like GOVERNANCE, SECURITY and SUPPORT.

### For example

Using a support file, via a team agreement, could be a useful location for providing contact details and who to ask for help during remote, days to week long events. This could be a centralised location and is always visible when creating issue on GitHub.com or via cloned files.

### Custom Common Files

The following are adopting practices from using GitHub Marketplace apps/actions or per config variants that control the repository and its behaviours/consistency.   

10. [ðŸ“‚./codemeta.json](../codemeta.json)<sup>*Optional*</sup> - See the [CODE FAIR GitHub App]() and `CITATIONS.cff`<sup>ðŸ”¸</sup>
