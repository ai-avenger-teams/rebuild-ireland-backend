# Guide to Contributing to the `{PROJECT|HACKATHON}` Community
When interacting, strive to maintain a friendly, empathetic tone. This includes, but is not limited to, interactions on `{Discord|Slack}`, GitHub, and other Social Media associated with `{PROJECT|HACKATHON}`.

**"Tone"** refers to word, punctuation, and conversational choices that determine how your message feels to others. This includes nonverbal cues, like emojis, memes and gifs.

Compare these two responses:

*Question*: Hey, I'm beginning with `{PROJECT|HACKATHON}`. I tried to use document in my `{PROJECT|HACKATHON}` item, but it says that the object doesn't exist. How can I manipulate the DOM?

| Answer 1 | Answer 2 | 
| :--- | :--- |
| You can't manipulate the DOM from an `{PROJECT\|HACKATHON}` file üòÇ Astro is a static site builder. |	Hey, welcome to the community!<br>‚ñ™Ô∏è Astro pages and components run on the server.<br> ‚ñ™Ô∏è Because of that, you won't have access to everything you're used to when writing JavaScript for the web. <br>‚ñ™Ô∏è You're on the right track, though - you can access document from a <script> tag in your `{PROJECT\|HACKATHON}` file. Check out the docs here, and let me know if you need any more help! `{Add: URL}`|

*Answer 2* centered the user's feelings and as such, took more effort. However, it made a significant difference. This response:

- welcomed the new member into the community
- made them feel validated for asking the question ("You're on the right track")
- provided an explanation that fit the person who asked the question: Answer 2 sought to explain things to a self-described beginner, who might not understand the implications of "static site builder"
- made it clear that the community is willing to help and that asking is not a burden ("let me know if you need any more help!")
- equipped them with a next step ("Check out the docs here"), while at the same time familiarized them onto our docs page

Our community/team prides itself on being positive, helpful, and inclusive. If you have these goals in mind when interacting in the community, you're on the right track!

- **<ins>To stay positive</ins>**:
    - *Make it clear* that you appreciate the other person's contributions.
    - *Aim to learn*: even complaints can be valuable feedback.
    - *Look for alternate interpretations* of your message before sending, and consider clarifying your intent if you're unsure how your words might come across 
        - ..(using exclamation points and emojis to convey friendliness is generally üëç !)
    - *During conflict*: maintain respect, avoid aggression, and avoid making it personal ("you").
    - *Set boundaries*. Feel free to step away from a conversation when you feel frustrated. Reach out to community leaders who can step in and de-escalate the situation. We are in this together!

- **<ins>To stay helpful</ins>**:

    - *Understand Outcomes*: Seek to understand the other person's desired outcomes. Are they looking for assistance? Just wanting to vent?
    - *Meet them at their level*: When explaining something, first establish the knowledge level of the person you're responding to. 
        - Match your explanation to that level. 
        - A good rule of thumb is to assume that everyone is a beginner. 
        - Your response will most likely be read by others as well!
    - *Ask clarifying questions*. If you're not sure what the person meant, ask them if your understanding is correct. If you're not sure what they already know, ask them if they're familiar with a concept.

- **<ins>To stay inclusive</ins>**:

    - *Preferred name*: Refer to someone by their expressed name. Don't use your own nicknames for someone (unless you're friends with established trust).
    - *Preferred pronoun*: Refer to someone by their expressed pronouns. If this wasn't expressed, use they/them, which in English can be used to refer to individuals of any gender.
    - *Ensourage and support*: If you sense hesitancy in someone's participation, make it clear that you're happy they're participating.
    - *Advocate*: Advocate for someone if you see that they're being dismissed.
