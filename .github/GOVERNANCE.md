# Governance

> This document outlines the governance model for `{PROJECT|HACKATHON}`. This includes detailed descriptions of different roles, `{nomination|selection}` processes, code review processes, and Code of Conduct enforcement.

ðŸ‘‰ All community members must follow the [Code of Conduct (CoC).]()

## Get Involved
Anything that supports the Astro community is a valuable contribution!

All types of contribution are meaningful. This can include code changes, type fixes, `{Discord|Slack}` activity, and even posting about `{PROJECT|HACKATHON}` to your personal blog. No contribution is too small!

Anyone can become an `{PROJECT|HACKATHON}` collaborator | contributor (yes, even you!). Engineering ability is not required. Our goal is to recognize all contributors to the project regardless of skill, experience or background.

## Contributor Levels
We recognize different levels of contribution as four different Collaborator | Contributor Levels. Because each level comes with a new set of privileges and responsibilities, you may also see these levels referred to as Contributor Roles.

Collaborator | Contributor levels are available to all members of the `{PROJECT|HACKATHON}` community, regardless of coding skill or experience.

Two important things that we look for in a contributor are:

- Being here - Everyone's time is valuable, and the fact that you're here and contributing to Astro is amazing! Thank you for being a part of this project with us.
- Being a positive member of our community - Go above and beyond our [Code of Conduct]() and commit to healthy communication across pull requests, issue discussions, `{Discord|Slack}` conversations, and any interactions outside of our community (ex: no Twitter bullies allowed :)

All Collaborator | Contributor roles are granted for as long as the individual wishes to engage with the project.

Collaborator | Contributor can voluntarily leave the project at any time. See Retiring a Role below for more information.

In extreme cases -- such as a Code of Conduct violation -- a role may be revoked by a project Steward at their discretion.

Each new Collaborator | Contributor level unlocks new privileges and responsibilities both on Discord and on GitHub. Below is a summary of each level.

### Level 1 (L1)- Contributor

## Level 3 (L3) - Maintainer
The Maintainer role is available to contributors who want to join the team and take part in the long-term maintenance and growth of `{PROJECT|HACKATHON}`.

The Maintainer role is critical to the long-term health of `{PROJECT|HACKATHON}`. Maintainers act as the first line of defense when it comes to new issues, pull requests and Discord activity. Maintainers are most likely the first people that a user will interact with on `{Discord|Slack}` or GitHub.

Maintainers are not required to write code! Some Maintainers spend most of their time inside of `{Discord|Slack}`, maintaining a healthy community there. Others work on technical documentation, support, or design.

A Maintainer has moderation privileges! All maintainers are trusted with the ability to help moderate our `{Discord|Slack}` and GitHub communities for things like spam. There is also a special (optional, opt-in) @mods role open to maintainers who are also interested in helping out when a community member reaches out for moderation help.

## Moderation
Outlined below is the process for Code of Conduct violation reviews.

### Reporting
Anyone may report a violation. Violations can be reported in the following ways:

- In private, via email to one or more stewards.
- In private, via direct message to a project steward on `{Discord|Slack}`.
- In public, via a GitHub comment (mentioning `{@mod/voilations}`).
- In public, via the project`{Discord|Slack}`.server (mentioning staff).

### Who gets involved?
Each report will be assigned reviewers. These will initially be all project stewards.

In the event of any conflict of interest - ie. stewards who are personally connected to a situation, they must immediately recuse themselves.

At request of the reporter and if deemed appropriate by the reviewers, another neutral third-party may be involved in the review and decision process.

### Review
If a report doesnâ€™t contain enough information, the reviewers will strive to obtain all relevant data before acting.

The reviewers will then review the incident and determine, to the best of their ability:

- What happened.
- Whether this event constitutes a Code of Conduct violation.
- Who, if anyone, was involved in the violation.
- Whether this is an ongoing situation.

The reviewers should aim to have a resolution agreed very rapidly; if not agreed within a week, they will inform the parties of the planned date.

### Resolution
Responses will be determined by the reviewers on the basis of the information gathered and of the potential consequences. It may include:

- taking no further action
- issuing a reprimand (private or public)
- asking for an apology (private or public)
- permanent ban from the GitHub org and Discord server
- revoked contributor status
