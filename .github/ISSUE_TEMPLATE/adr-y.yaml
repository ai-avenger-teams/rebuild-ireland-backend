        2. *facing*: `non-functional requirement, for instance a desired quality,  
        3. *we decided*: `decision outcome` (arguably the most important part),
        4. and *neglected alternatives* not chosen (not to be forgotten!),
        5. *to achieve*: `benefits``, the full or partial satisfaction of requirement(s),
        6. *accepting that*: `drawbacks and other consequences`, for instance impact on other properties/context and effort/cost (both short term and long term).
